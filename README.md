PostGraphile Examples
=====================

This repository will contain examples of using PostGraphile with different servers and clients.

To get started:

```
npm install -g yarn
yarn
./setup.sh
yarn start
```

This will run the koa2 server and react client.

It's recommended that you review the setup.sh script before executing it.

Koa2
----

Koa 2 only has "experimental" support in PostGraphile officially, but if you
face any issues please file them against PostGraphile with full reproduction
instructions - we're trying to elevate Koa to full support status.
